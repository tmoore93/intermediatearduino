Led blink revisited was about learning how to use solidworks.
It was a thing that made an led blink. in this you used an arduino
and wiring. Some things to remember from this is making sure you are in the
correct serial port and arduino type. Also remember to use serial monitor

lcd hello world was using an lcd to say something and then have something
that had a variable. This was a new thing.you had to use libraries
at the beggining you had to wire using 16 wires. then you could use a
lcd backpack. This made wiring a lot easier. Also i learned that some pins
are analog pins and some are digital pins.

Photointerrupters were these little things that used light to see if
something was there. like a type of motion sensor. This was used with
an led. based on what the photointerrupter read it made an led turn
on or off. Some problems i faced were makiing sure that the wiring for 
these things connected them. also making sure that photointerrupter
read right. 

Potentiometer is a little dial thing that turns. This project you made an 
lcd show what the dial read. you had to use map which made it so that
it can be read. This made it so that you could show what the potentiometer
was reading on an lcd. I had lots of problems with this one. The thing that
was important was making sure that the p. was connected to the lcd. also 
since we were using a back pack it was harder for me to understand how to 
wire in the p. to the lcd. 

Motor control was just about getting a motor to run.for this you had
 to have a battery pack and a motor. Also you could make a 
motor go different speeds using a potentiometer. This means they each 
had to have their own power sources.  
This was hard to get the motor to continously go and work. it would go in
and out. also the p. controlling the motor was odd. the motor would go to 
slow or fast and would seem slow to react.
