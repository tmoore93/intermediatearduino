Led blink revisited was about learning how to use sublime.
It was a thing that made an led blink. in this you used an arduino
and wiring. Some things to remember from this is making sure you are in the
correct serial port and arduino type. Also remember to use serial monitor. 
Some problems I faced with this was making sure everything was there, and
that it was using the different way.

lcd hello world was using an lcd to say something and then have something
that had a variable. This was a new thing.you had to use libraries
at the beggining you had to wire using 16 wires. then you could use a
lcd backpack. This made wiring a lot easier. Also I learned that some pins
are analog pins and some are digital pins.
With this I accidently sodered two of them together, so I had to unsoder them
and then resoder them. When I did this it fixed the problems.

Photointerrupters were these little things that used light to see if
something was there. like a type of motion sensor. This was used with
an led. based on what the photointerrupter read it made an led turn
on or off. Some problems I faced were making sure that the wiring for 
these things connected them. Also making sure that photointerrupter
read right. 
A problem with this is that it didn't work at first, since the code was wrong

Potentiometer is a little dial thing that turns. This project you made an 
lcd show what the dial read. You had to use map which made it so that
it can be read. This made it so that you could show what the potentiometer
was reading on an lcd. I had lots of problems with this one. The thing that
was important was making sure that the potentiometer was connected to the lcd.
 Also since we were using a back pack it was harder for me to understand how to 
wire in the pontentiometer to the lcd. 
I learned more about the backpack thing. Also potentiometers.
For this I had to fix the wiring for the potentiometer so that it would 
be with the lcd. Then I also learned that lcds and potentiometers need to be 
analog pins.

Motor control was just about getting a motor to run.For this you had
 to have a battery pack and a motor. Also you could make a 
motor go different speeds using a potentiometer. This means they each 
had to have their own power sources. For this I had to switch out the motor,
which fixed the problem of it not listening to the potentiomter.  
This was hard to get the motor to continously go and work. it would go in
and out. also the potentiometer controlling the motor was odd.
The motor would go to slow or fast and would seem slow to react.
 For this I had to switch out the motor,
which fixed the problem of it not listening to the potentiomter. Then also 
making sure that the wiring for the motor was right. I had to redo the wiring
multiple times but eventually got it right.
Some things I learned were liquid crystal, and using sublime.
Sublime works similarly to arduino, but has differeninces.
Liquid crystal can be two different things, so finding out which one 
is something. I also learned how all of these things fit together, and what
they do.
